# Evolutionary optimization

## Files
- `cocrystal_processing.py`: file to run the process of evolutionary optimization with different initial population
- `analysis.py`: file with code to analyse results of `cocrystal_processing.py`
- `scripts`: package with code for GOLEM
  - `mol_graph.py`: graph representation of a molecule 
  - `mol_adapter.py`: adapter to map `MolGraph` to internal GOLEM graph representation `OptGraph`
  - `mol_mutations.py`: mutation functions on molecules
  - `mol_advisor.py`: class to advise mutations on possible actions to avoid infeasible structures
  - `mol_metrics.py`: metrics used to assess generated coformers
  - `mol_graph_parameters.py`: class to set constraints which are specific for molecular structures
  - `constants.py`: file with required constants
  - `utils.py`: useful helper functions
- `GraphGA_baseline`: files for comparison with GraphGA

## Run from the command line
To start evolutionary search run:
```commandline
   python -m GOLEM.cocrystal_processing
```
Available parameters:
- `-drug`: drug for which we are aiming to find coformers (default: `'CN1C2=C(C(=O)N(C1=O)C)NC=N2'`)
- `-data_paths`: paths to csv files containing coformers that will be used as initial population (default: `'pipeline/result/GAN_all_valid.csv'`). You can find files with coformers generated by different NN models in `pipeline/result`
- `-coformers_col_name`: name of the column containing coformers for previously passed csv files (default: `'generated_coformers'`)
- `-results_folder`: path to the folder to save obtained results (default: `'GOLEM/results'`)
